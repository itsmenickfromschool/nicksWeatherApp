# Nick's Weather App! 

## Description
A link to the deployed app can be found [here](https://itsmenickfromschool.github.io/nicksWeatherApp/)

This app is built as a simple way to get the weather for a city or town. It uses the open weather API. I built this as a way to further my javascript knowledge. During this process I became familiar with using API calls, keys, and fetch. I personally really enjoyed this project as it was a big step, During the beginning of it I was very overwhelmed, but I feel like I made a huge amount of progress. I also enjoyed it because weather is a huge part of my life, I spend a lot of time outside, and when I was in college at the University of Utah I studied climate change and landscape dynamics. This is very on-brand for me. 

## Installation

If you want to try this out on your local machine feel free to clone the repository and check out my code as well as run it in your browser. 

## Usage

This app is fairly simple. When the webpage loads you land on a screen explaining it has the weather for Zigzag, which is a town near Mount Hood, in Oregon. I chose this as a default page because I think it has a fun name. To use the app more just search the place you want, and a fetch will be made for the city you want. Additionally, places you have searched before are saved in localStorage as clickable buttons, to use these just click them and they load.

## Collaborators

This app was built by me, Nicholas Burr, however I also recieved some general code suggestions and debugging help from the askBCS staff at EDX2U. Finally, Dru Sanchez, who is an EDX2U tutor, was really helpful guiding me through learning more about how to solve little bugs I had along the way. 

## Moving Forward

in the future I would like to change how the five day data is grabbed from the openWeather API, currently the times are based off of when you are looking, but 1 day into the future, so this creates not the most useful forecast, if you look for the weather at night it will give you the forecast for the next five days, but at night as well. This shouldn't be too complex of a fix.
